# Clone Recipes
>   This has been and probably always will be one of the most frequently asked questions anywhere DIY is discussed. From the ECF forum in 2009 to the DIY Discord in 2020, every DIY FB group, and even ELR’s own forum are consistently pinged with this same request **“How can I make something that tastes like X?”** 

>  Clones are often a starting point for a lot of new DIY’ers. They look at DIY as a way to save money by mixing up their ADV themselves, at a fraction of the cost. And because they’re new to DIY and new to the forum, they don’t realize how many times the same request has been made before they got there. 

> With the upcoming regulations and the potential for your favorite juice to disappear from the shelves, now is as good a time as any to start working on that clone.

   

##**Finding Clone Recipes is easy...**
but finding recipes that actually taste exactly like the juice you’re trying to clone? Pretty far from it. Searching ELR returns 4,446 recipes with **clone** in the name (another 852 with remix) but there are a few interesting points to consider when you break down the recipes by rating. 

> The first 10 pages (250 recipes) are rated 3,885 times (2,387 for the first 50 recipes) and the number of ratings drops to 3 by the time you reach page 10. Keep in mind that nearly every recipe on ELR is rated 5 stars by its [proud author](https://i.imgur.com/43K14Jk.png).

 - 21 recipes from 2014
 - 96 recipes from 2015
 - 100 recipes from 2016
 - 26 recipes from 2017
 - And an astonishingly low 7 made in the last 2 years.

Of course if I were to pull all the data there would be a lot more clones created in the last 2 years but what that shows is that the number of people trying and rating (or confirming their accuracy) is essentially nil. And with nearly half those **highly rated** clones being conceived 5+ years ago, the accuracy, if it existed in the first place, might only exist with 5+ year old gear.

ATF is just as bad with 105 “clone” recipes and 258 “remix” recipes that, while typically made in the last 2 years, are rated far less frequently. 

What does that all mean? It might mean that looking at existing clone recipes makes for a better reference than a guide and that mixing that one clone attempt you find on ELR with 3 ratings might not be the best first step.

Better steps below, read on.

   

  
##**Monthly Clone Request Thread**

How you ask is more important than what you’re asking for. The key isn’t always to try and find someone who has actually tried the juice but instead describing what you’re tasting well enough that people can help you find the flavors that are close to what you’re looking for. Ultimately it will fall on your palate to decide. Recipes and advice posted in the thread can help you narrow your search and speed up the development process. 

The more information you share, the more you’ll get back in return.

##**Picking your flavors**

- Take notes on your juice; Even if you think your palate isn’t up to par or finding the words to describe what you’re tasting doesn’t come naturally, taking notes will give you a way to break down your subjective experience. Figure out what the most prominent flavor is and then search for the accents. At the very least you’ll have a reference as you search recipes and/or post a request.  
- [The Flavor Review Wiki](https://link.diyejuice.org/reviews) is a great resource for looking up reviews of flavors you’ve identified in the juice you want to clone. It gives you a starting point and ideas on what to add to your cart or wish list. 
- If you can't find a full review for a flavor you're interested in you might find some notes or impression in the [Flavor Notes](https://link.diyejuice.org/notes) wiki.
- Depending on how popular the juice that you’re trying to clone is, you’ll likely find an attempt with a quick search on ELR or ATF. Sort by rating and then look through all the recipes to find similarities between them. 
- Try to find recipes with descriptions that mirror your experience. If they have no description at all, it's not only a shot in the dark, it's very likely they didn't put a lot of effort into the recipe. 
- Rich from Gremlin Juice/DIY explains [How cost/availability factors in](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3sdfqe/what_company_do_you_reckon_most_premium_juice/cwwb67e/) to commercial juice. Most companies will stick with flavors that are easy to stock and inexpensive in bulk. 
  

You can also take a peek behind the veil and look over the commercial recipes posted on the sub to get an idea of what they’re using.
