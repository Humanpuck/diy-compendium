I’m not sure where you draw the line between using a cream as a cream flavor and using it to enhance the mouthfeel. There’s a lot of room for subjectivity due to the fact that people’s sensitivity to flavors means that while one person might find a low percentage of FA Pear adds juiciness to their recipe, others might might taste an overripe pear note that detracts from the main profile they’re after. Consensus is just a line that divides a full spectrum of experience and while that line can often be broad enough to leave a small subset of outliers it can also, on occasion, leave a large minority wondering what everyone else is thinking.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>FLV Lovage</strong>&nbsp;&#8211; “This is more of a flavor additive than stand alone. The review on the Flavorah website states that it &#8220;tones&#8221; flavors, and that seems as good a description as any. It seems to round out and give volume to green flavors, for better or worse. It also works a lot like a better version of ethyl maltol on citrus and seems to really define the edges of the flavors in tobaccos.” from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/concreteriver\">/u/concreteriver</a><sup></sup><a href=\"javascript:void 0\">[+30]</a>’s&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.reddit.com//r/DIY_eJuice/comments/5ko0w1/flv_lovage/\">review</a><sup></sup></li><li><strong>INW Cactus</strong>&nbsp;&#8211; Often used as a way to add “moisture” or “juiciness” to fruit recipes.
