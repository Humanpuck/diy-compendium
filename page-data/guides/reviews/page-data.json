The first is obviously when someone mixes a recipe and doesn&#8217;t take the time to leave a review or forgets to leave a review. This is disappointing because reviews are what make us all better. The second non review class is a negative non review. For whatever reason some people are afraid to leave negative feedback. It could be because they don&#8217;t want to piss people off and be &#8220;black balled&#8221; by the community or because the mixer is a popular personality and everyone else seems to enjoy the recipe. This is even more disappointing to me. If you have a negative review and leave constructive feedback, there should be no reason that it will ruffle any feathers. Negative feedback is often more valuable than positive feedback. Just be constructive about it.</li><li><strong>Critical review gold</strong> &#8211; The last is the best, a well thought out reviews that outline exactly why a recipe is good, what techniques you&#8217;re impressed with, and any suggestions or constructive criticism you may may have. The criticism is usually subjective in the form of alternative flavor suggestions, percentage tweaks, steeping problems, or personal palate issues with certain ingredients. These reviews are probably the most rewarding for both parties. Not only do you get to stroke the ego of a fellow mixer, you also get to help them improve their mix/ability by providing much needed constructive criticism. Not every mix is perfect and we all usually have ideas for improvement. Share them!</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Unbiased, constructive criticism is priceless in our craft. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, I really do want to know &#8220;the good, the bad, and the ugly&#8221; as it pertains to my creations. All opinions whether positive or negative are welcome as long as they help me improve. I&#8217;m a big boy and I have a whole drawer full of big boy panties. This criticism helps me to be a better mixer and understand how others taste and perceive my mixes. If you love (or hate) something I&#8217;ve created, tell me so, and tell me why, in specific details. Even if you think I&#8217;m crazy and should probably cut my tongue out and burn it (but don&#8217;t say that, be nice).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ll leave you with this&#8230; If you take the time to mix something please also take the time to review it.
