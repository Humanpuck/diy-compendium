I’ve seen it on every DIY forum, chat room, FB group, etc and because of its frequency it’s one the first questions to get the ire of a community or be outright banned as a topic of discussion. Clones are often a starting point for a lot of new DIY’ers. They look at DIY as a way to save money by mixing up their ADV themselves, at a fraction of the cost. And because they’re new to DIY and new to the forum, they don’t realize how many times the same request has been made before they got there. This page will help you on not only requesting a clone, but making one yourself.</p>\n<h2><strong>Requesting A Clone</strong></h2>\n<p>How you ask is more important than what you’re asking for. The key isn’t always to try and find someone who has actually tried the juice but instead describing what you’re tasting well enough that people can help you find the flavors that are worth trying. Ultimately it will fall on your palate to decide, recipes and advice posted in the thread can help you narrow your search and speed up the development process. Heres some tips to help you get a better chance at someone cloning your request.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure to state the Brand and Flavour Name of the juice!</li>\n<li>Don't be vague about the flavour profile. The more descriptive the more likely someone will be able to clone the juice. Vape the commercial juice and take notes of what you taste, whats more prominent and whats more in the background, how it feels to vape it, etc. Building up a detailed profile will also help you clone the juice yourself if you decide to do so.</li>\n<li>Look on ATF &#x26; ELR to check if a clone has already been made. If there has already been an attempt and it is well reviewed, you will most likely not get someone to clone it for you, and are better off using the one that is already highly rated - or adjusting that yourself. </li>\n<li>Make sure to request on our Monthly Thread, people are much more likely to see it there. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/wiki/monthly_clone_requests\">Monthly Clone Request Threads</a></p>\n<h2><strong>Cloning Tips</strong></h2>\n<p>Cloning a commercial E-Juice isn't always a simple task. Here are a few tips to help you pick out your flavours, and hopefully be able to crack down on your favourite commercial E-Juice.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take notes; Even if you think your palate isn’t up to par or finding the words to describe what you’re tasting doesn’t come naturally, taking notes will give you a way break down your subjective experience. Figure out what the most prominent flavor is and then search for the accents. At the very least you’ll have a reference as you search recipes and/or post a request.</li>\n<li>Test, Take Note, Let Steep, and do the process again. It's very vital to also always go back and reference the commercial juice if possible while doing this. Building up your notes and gaining a better understanding of the flavour concentrates / profile you are achieving will help you immensely. </li>\n<li>Depending on how popular the juice that you’re trying to clone is, you’ll likely find an attempt with a quick search on ELR or ATF. Sort by rating and then look through all the recipes to find similarities.</li>\n<li>Check out the <a href=\"https://diyejuice.org/flavors/reviews\">Flavour Review Page</a>. It's a great resource for looking up reviews of flavors you’ve identified in the juice you want to clone. It gives you a starting point and ideas on what to add to your cart or wishlist.</li>\n<li>Wayne has a short video on cloning that you can watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0vJ1U2jqk\">here</a>.
