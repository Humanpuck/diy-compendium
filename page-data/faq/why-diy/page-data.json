It&#8217;s easy to read, &#8220;I save a lot of money \nmaking my own e-liquid&#8221;, but it&#8217;s not that simple. DIY takes some \nupfront capital, lots of experimentation, sometimes multiple orders from\n multiple suppliers, failures, handling hazardous materials, and \npatience. First you should probably figure out exactly why you want to \nDIY.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why Do You Want to DIY Anyway?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\n are lots of reasons, and none of them are exactly bad, but some of them\n may be unrealistic or invalid for you. I don&#8217;t know your situation, so \nthe answer is always, &#8220;it depends.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;I want to Save Money.&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s\n true that finished DIY juice is usually cheaper by volume than even the\n most basic of commercial juice. I say &#8220;usually&#8221; because it&#8217;s possible \nto pick up some truly awful stuff at $0.10/ml, and a juice using a lot \nof expensive flavorings can easily go over $0.20/ml. Granted the \nexpensive stuff &#8220;should&#8221; taste better, but taste is subjective and maybe\n it doesn&#8217;t matter that much to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However,\n the combined cost for your super-awesome homemade super inexpensive \ne-liquid isn&#8217;t the whole story. You need to spend money upfront, \nsometimes hundreds of dollars on flavors, nic, bottles, labels, safety \nequipment (goggles, gloves, etc) and either volumetric (syringes, \npipettes, etc) or weight mixing (scale) equipment&#8230; all the things that\n you&#8217;ll find elsewhere in this wiki, and then some. And then there&#8217;s the\n cost of the juices that fail completely, the stuff you spill, the stuff\n you give away to your friends because you need feedback, etc. etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\n will pay off&#8230; eventually. If you&#8217;re really curious, calculate the \namount you spend per week on juice, compare that to the money you&#8217;re \ngoing to spend to start up, and see how long it takes to get your money \nback. If you&#8217;re super-budget conscious and spend $15 a week on liquid \nand your initial hardware capital (mixing stuff, etc.) costs you $40 and\n your juice cost is about $0.10/ml, it should take you about 3.5 weeks \nto recoup your costs. That&#8217;s not always true, of course, since you will \nlikely vape more on flavor tests and the like, and it doesn&#8217;t quite \ncover the investment in bulk liquids you made. If your total outlay \nincluding flavors and nic base is closer to $200, it&#8217;s more like 15 \nweeks. Still a good deal, but it&#8217;s not the instant savings many imagine \nit to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if you want to save\n money because you would like to clone (that is, make an identical copy)\n of a premium juice? Mixers of reputable premium lines spend a lot of \ntime developing their flavors, and you&#8217;re not likely to duplicate their \nrecipes with your 6 sample flavors and a recipe you found online, though\n there are some famous recipes out there that can be similar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;<em>I Want to Know What&#8217;s In My Juice</em>.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If\n this is your motivation, then DIY is the best option for you. Note that\n any reputable juice vendor will tell you if they have a specific \ningredient in their mix like diacetyl, but sometimes they don&#8217;t know, \nunderestimate the toxicity of an additive, or are just scum who don&#8217;t \ncare. DIY lets you control your ingredients to the extent that you \nunderstand your components. Titrate your nicotine base, carefully \ninvestigate all your flavors, determine your ideal PG/VG ratio,  and not\n resort to non-USP solvents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;<em>Nobody Makes the Flavor I Want</em>.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\n may not be quite true; it might be more accurate to say, &#8220;Nobody makes \nthe flavor I want at an affordable price&#8221; or “it’s too costly and time \nconsuming to find a juice I like.” There are some flavors that are \nnotoriously difficult to mix, or nigh-impossible. For picky palates, \neven with the wide array of flavor profiles available in commercial \njuices, there’s still the hit or miss &#8220;is it any good?&#8221; problem. With \nDIY, you can toss the odd test batch of something new you made for \npennies per ml rather than buying a 30ml of some juice and finding you \ncan&#8217;t vape even half of the bottle..</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;I Want to Open a Commercial Line of E Juice</em>.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not\n to say that it can&#8217;t be done, but making a juice that has mass appeal, \nor even niche appeal, and being able to support commercial production is\n very difficult. Do you have an LLC? Can you afford insurance? Can you \ntake credit cards? Do you know B&amp;M owners who will stock your stuff,\n whether wholesale or consignment? How good are you at promotion? My \nadvice is to start out trying to make juice that you and your \nfriends/family like, see if a wider circle likes it, and go from there. \nAs a side note here, if you reside in the United States, as the \nsituation sits now it is nearly impossible to introduce new e-liquid on \nto the market due to overwhelmingly expensive fees and strict \nregulations on all tobacco products. Basically, if you live in the US, \nit ain&#8217;t’ happenin’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;<em>I&#8217;m concerned that the government may seize the means to acquire nicotine or flavorings!</em>&#8220;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\n seems more likely that nic may become more expensive as it becomes more\n regulated. A bigger concern might be the unavailability of your \nfavorite juice provider(s) due to increased compliance costs. \nFortunately, nic base is relatively inexpensive and will last in brown \nglass in the freezer for several years at the very least, and you don&#8217;t \nuse all that much. Keep an eye out for nic sales from vendors who aren&#8217;t\n terrible and take a shot. Another side note here; if you&#8217;re in the USA \nthe FDA is attempting to regulate flavored tobacco products and flavored\n e-liquid unfortunately falls into this category. It seems unlikely that\n the multiuse flavorings that we use will be outright banned, but prices\n or taxes on them may very well increase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;It Sounds Fun</em>.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is. This may be the best reason of all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;<em>It looks easy.&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\n can be! DIY only has to be as complicated as you want. Sure you could \ndevelop all your own flavors and experiment with all different kinds of \nconcentrates and create new recipes, but you can also cherry pick some \nrecipes online with flavor profiles you think you&#8217;d like, and buy \nconcentrates accordingly, and then just mix by numbers from there. Doing\n DIY is somewhat like owning a 3D printer. You may find that you become a\n recipe making genius, but if not there&#8217;s a whole world of recipes out \nthere that other people have created.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Are the Downsides of DIY?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\n are a few. It&#8217;s easy for an experienced mixer to say, &#8220;Oh there are no \ndownsides.&#8221; It&#8217;s possible that they were a natural when they started, \nbut maybe they forgot how terrible they were when they started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>DIY Requires Handling Hazardous Chemicals</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nicotine\n is toxic. Never forget that. I think to myself, &#8220;Nicotine is toxic&#8221; the\n same way I think, &#8220;Every gun is loaded.&#8221; Yes, you might spill some on \nyou and just get a head rush for a while, or no ill effects. Why do you \neven need gloves? You never spill anything. Well, that&#8217;s true, until you\n do. Safety equipment is not there to keep you from having to pay \nattention; it&#8217;s there to save your ass when something unexpected goes \nwrong. It will also kill children and pets in much lighter \nconcentrations. It will also kill idiot roommates who don&#8217;t know what \nthe hell they&#8217;re taking out of the freezer late at night when they&#8217;re \nsnooping around for your vodka bottles. If any of this makes you \nuncomfortable, you might think twice about handling high concentration \nnicotine in your household.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>DIY = Lots of New Stuff</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bottles.\n Flavors. Test vials. Liter or gallon jugs of propylene glycol and \nvegetable glycerin. You should ideally have a separate room where you \nwork on this, or at least a toolbench, lab bench, or even just a rack of\n trays to hold all of the equipment that you&#8217;re going to be spending \nyour money on, if only to keep yourself from tripping over things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>DIY Requires Patience</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If\n you think waiting two weeks for your bottle of liquid to steep is \nannoying, wait until you have twenty-something tester bottles of juice \nsitting in a dark box somewhere. If you don&#8217;t mind the wait, you might \nnot have this problem, but generally people who DIY tend to spend a lot \nof time dialing in flavors and experimenting. It&#8217;s one of the reasons we\n do it in the first place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TLDR?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bottom\n line is DIY may or may not be for you. If you&#8217;re in a living situation \nwhere nic base would be dangerous to keep around, like a home with small\n children, it may be difficult to find a safe place to work, make sure \nto keep nicotine and other chemicals out of reach of children and pets. \nBetter yet utilize a locking cabinet and store all nicotine and \ne-liquids locked up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, for \nthose of us who want to know what goes into our juice, and those with an\n eye toward experimental flavor combinations, this may be right for you.\n You can save up for the initial investment, start keeping careful \nrecords, and even if you don&#8217;t create a recipe that is out of this \nworld, you will have the satisfaction of vaping something you created, \nsomething you can tweak to your liking, something that&#8217;s better than \nmost of the commercial stuff on the market. And even if it&#8217;s only &#8220;as \ngood,&#8221; it costs you a tiny fraction of what it would in a store, and to \nme that automatically makes it better.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> <em>This is not my original article at all.
