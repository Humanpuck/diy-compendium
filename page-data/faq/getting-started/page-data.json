No matter how you go about it, putting in some effort before you order will save you a lot of grief later on.

This is considered the smallest possible size for accuracy, without wasting too much on failed experiments. Some larger bottles such as 30/60/100 ml will come in handy when you&#8217;ve found recipes you enjoy. LDPE is the most convenient material as it is soft and easy to squeeze.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Measuring</strong>&nbsp;&#8211; A scale with 0.01 gram accuracy is necessary, and a 500 gram capacity will cover most of your mixing needs. Something in the $15-30 range will do, but avoid those with auto shut-off if possible. While you can measure by volume too, it is much more of a hassle and will save neither time nor money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pipettes</strong>&nbsp;&#8211; Small disposable plastic pipettes may come in handy as some flavor concentrates come in bottles without drop tips.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is all you really need to get started, but start small. A liter of VG (or premix), 250-500 ml of PG, 100 ml of nicotine, 10-20 flavor concentrates and bottles, a sufficient scale and some pipettes is a good sized starter kit. You don&#8217;t want to spend a fortune on your first order for two important reasons. First, you won&#8217;t know for sure that you&#8217;ll enjoy mixing until you&#8217;ve tried it. But more importantly, once you&#8217;ve tried some flavors and recipes, you&#8217;ll have a far better idea of what to order next time. Then you can scale up your supplies according to your own needs and make much better decisions about what flavors you actually want. So start small and work your way up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is plenty of additional gear that may add comfort or convenience, such as funnels, condiment bottles, protective gear, an RDA for ease of sampling, the list goes on. But that is all optional and to a large degree depends on your personal needs and what your vendors have to offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to nicotine, local regulations may limit your options and there may be shipping restrictions.
