If the PG is over 50%, you’ve gone too far…</p>\n<p>The premixed base I see the most regret over purchasing has to be 50/50. It’s rare that anyone has a preference of PG at over 50% of a mix, let alone the kind of gear that would work well with that ratio.

At its most convenient, you’ll simply take your premixed base (ex. 80/20 @ 6mg) and fill your bottle shot all the way up. Shake it, steep it and voila, you’ve got eLiquid.
